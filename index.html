	<h2>What is Magic: the Gathering?</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic: the Gathering</a> is a collectible card game that is over 20 years old. Players collect different cards which they combine into custom decks which they use to play against other people. The cards are organized into <a href="http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Color_Pie">five colors</a> which each represent a philosophy and get to do unique things.

	<h2>What is Drafting</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Draft">Drafting</a> is a special way of playing Magic: the Gathering which creates a game around choosing which cards you choose to put in your deck. A group of 8 players all receive a pack of 15 cards from which they choose one, and then pass the rest to the next person in their group. This process repeats itself until all the cards have been chosen, after which the players open another pack of 15 cards. One more pack is opened after that, and the draft ends when each player has chosen 45 cards. From their 45 cards, and a <a href="http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Basic_lands">set of "basic" cards</a> which anyone can use as many of which as they want, the players then create their 40 card decks and play against one another.

	<h2>What is Cube?</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Cube_Draft">Cube</a> is a special type of drafting. The set of cards from which the packs of 15 are created is called the Cube. Where the name itself came from is unknown, along with any significance or meaning that may come along with it. The <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist">"Traditional"</a> Cube is made up of 540 unique cards which are some of the most powerful, famous, or fun cards in the history of the game.

	<h2>So why are you making one of these?</h2>
	<p>
		Wizards of the Coast has decided that they will hold a competition amongst the community to find the next Cube they will use for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_Online">Magic</a>. Five lists will be chosen by a set of judges to be voted on over the Internet by the community. Each finalist will receive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_Online#In-game_economy">the equivalent of</a> $1,000 and four of each card from their <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/kaladesh">newest set</a>, and the grand winner will receive an additional $1,000 and 4 more of each card. As someone who is interested in tinkering with things, this contest is an excuse for me to try my own hand at game design.

	<h2>What sort of Cube will you make?</h2>
	<p>
		The basic idea is to make a cube which focuses on one of the five colors presented in Magic: the Gathering: Black. The most of the 540 cards will be Black, and all the decks that are created will be at least partially Black. By choosing to focus on one color, I intend to create an experience unique drafting this cube. The other colors will still be present in order to make sure that the decks which are made by each player are unique and interesting. The current list can be found <a href="http://www.cubetutor.com/viewcube/62923">here</a>, and an explanation of the different archetypes can be found <a href="archetypes.html">here</a>.
