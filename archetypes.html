<h1>What is an Archetype?</h2>
<p>
	An Archetype is a basic framework or strategy which can be drafted in a <a href="">limited environment</a>. For instance, in a cube built around different types of creatures, some archetypes might include an elf deck, a goblin deck, or a vampire deck. Archetypes are one of the most important and difficult things for a cube designer to implement correctly, because each of these archetypes will be seen over and over again by the players. Each Archetype can also be loosely categorized as <a>Aggressive</a>,<a>Midrange</a>, <a>Controlling</a>, or <a>Combo</a>.
